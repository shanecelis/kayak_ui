## WARNING
Kayak UI is in the very early stages of development. Important features are missing and some documentation is missing. Kayak UI is designed to only work with Bevy.

## Features
- Easy to use declarative syntax using a custom proc macro
- Basic widget and global state management
- Input events (Mouse, Keyboard, Char)
- Fast and accurate layouts using morphorm: https://github.com/geom3trik/morphorm
- A few default widgets (check out Kayak's [built-in widgets](./src/widgets)!)
- Style system built to kind of mimic CSS styles.
- Image and Nine patch rendering.
- Vec widgets see vec example!

## Bevy Renderer Features
- Image and NinePatch renderer
- Fast MSDF Font renderer
- Quad renderer with rounded corners.
- Custom UI node to ensure UI renders on top of 3D and 2D entities.
- Fully integrated into bevy to capture input events, use bevy assets(images, etc).
- Dpi Scaling
- Batched Rendering
- Opacity Layers
- Custom Materials

## Missing features
- More default widgets.
- More events
